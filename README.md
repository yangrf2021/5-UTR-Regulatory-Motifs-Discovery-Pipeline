# 5-UTR-Regulatory-Motifs-Discovery-Pipeline
A computational framework for identifying 5'UTR regulatory motifs in translationally regulated genes, particularly those affected by METTL5-mediated rRNA methylation in prostate cancer. This pipeline integrates multiple motif discovery algorithms with advanced statistical analysis to identify sequence elements that control translation efficiency.
